The following are the instruction for running the demo code:
1> When you run the ipynb code you will be asked to enter the path of the image in one of the cells after the loading of dataset and training of model is over.
2> Enter the path of the image in the slot .
3> The model will then run and then print the predicted person based on the image entered.

Note--> It is suggested to run the code in google colab as the code for loading dataset from kaggle using api may throw errors if runned elsewhere.
